Formerly known as "Harder Vanilla ft. More Doors". Terrible name.

The aim of this romhack is to strike a radical balance between freedom and difficulty.

* Walls of several rooms breached to make new shortcuts for ease of travel. Chaotic Realm now connects to Chapel via a door. Chapel is now essentially the game's "hub" area, with the save room close to both Hammer and a  portal room.
* Doors and transition rooms removed. Around 2% of the map is inaccessible.
* Souls and items drop a lot more often from enemies (10%~?).
* Some other souls and items scattered within the castle, obtainable earlier than usual.
* ALL souls obtainable before Chaotic Realm for an earlier Chaos Ring which may now appear near any save room. 
* Higher elemental variety among your weapons and red souls.
* Some yellow souls include effects of other yellow souls ("Dextro", "Gilded", etc.)
* Higher base MP regen. Base MP increased from 80 to 100.
* 
* MP doesn't increase on level-up.
* Your stats -50%. Enemy stats drastically increased, with more/changed resistances and a drastically reduced mass weakness to Holy.
* The way level stats are changed, you don't gain any stats except HP/LCK until Lv10.
* Severely reduced DEF stats from armor.
* Some enemies move faster than normal.
* Man-Eater added as fourth boss. Legion is NOT an optional boss. Defeating Legion unlocks rematches for certain bosses and adds late-game enemies to some rooms.

Extra notes:

* Poison here is colloquially referred to as "corrode" in item descriptions due to the changed archetype of enemies weak to poison (armors, golems, demons). It is arguable that corrode is the best status you can use at any point in the game.
* Stone weakness archetype is also changed (anyone with fast annoying movement). Some enemies aren't coded to allow stun by petrify, in which case they'd still take double damage.
* "KM" is of course the Killer Mantle effect, which has been rebalanced with enemies only gaining/losing 50% of their max HP if affected (except for special instakill cases).
* Weapons fully give STR instead of ATK now (unless 50% damage, then it's 50-50). Merely a buff to slide/kick damage and Great Armor soul.
* Book of Death still uses the original Death Scythe hitboxes, hence the absurd amount of vertical range.

Current bugs:

* Certain items aren't sellable due to a DSVedit bug when accessing the Shop List.
* If you happen to equip Chaos Ring really early (say, via New Game Plus) in a way that it'd give you negative INT, your blue souls may underflow and deal massive (sometimes negative) damage. I have no intention to fix this, because it's normally not possible to get Chaos Ring that early in regular gameplay. Also, it's funny.
* Palettes chosen for Chaotic Realm might have graphical glitches, and have questionable compatibility with recolour mods.

Thanks to:

* LagoLunatic, for DSVania Editor.
* For several patches I included because I like them:
* * caminopreacher - palette changes to Student Witch, Witch, Blue Crow, UI trims
* * DevAnj - MPRegen, INTpatch
* * radzo73 - EXP border fix
* * Xanthus - ASM patches to edit Soma's starting/levelup stats. Alucard Backdash, L-Cancel, patch that removes levelup pause and new soul OK delay, Single Jump Divekick, Zombie Officer heals 10 HP, Succubus heals 2 HP
* * Mako and Crossman - Hardcoded edits: Headhunter limit removed, Sherman Ring buffed to 500%. Idea that one-time bosses (Legion, Balore, etc.) can drop items. 'Aria of Sorrow Rebalanced' inspired me to make this mod to begin with.

Version

* 1.0 - Full release.

Author's Foreword

* Man I'm not gonna lie I don't know a lot of the technical stuff like RAM addresses. There's a few more I wanted to do like changing the title screen, changing the tiles of some rooms,
* * (I can't anymore, the addresses got shifted and I can't import from Tiled, same reason I can't edit anything in Chaotic Realm anymore, it just crashes the moment I try to view a Chaotic Realm room)
* changing the music,
* * (obviously I don't like the music for Castle Corridor, Dance Hall and Chaotic Realm, hence the replacements)
* fixing the shop so that every item is actually sellable-- It's a shame with the Ceramic items 'coz each of them cost like $50,000 to $250,000 which you would really want 'coz Positron Rifle costs $1,000,000 now.
* I've been trying to find the GFX pointer for the title screen and couldn't find it anywhere.

* The best I can offer is a perspective in like... concepts, progression, game balance. Nothing technically impressive. I'm just an "ideas guy".
* I only hope that my idea of fun still resonates with a lot of you.

* If you've read this far, know that you can beat this hack in under 50% Map completion, skipping at least 3 bosses. Good luck.
